# Introduction

FINOS projects are categorized according to the FINOS Project Lifecycle: each project is required to clearly display their Lifecycle Stage in the form of a badge in their README.md.

The Project Lifecycle is maintained by the [FINOS Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee) and serves as a recognition of governance transparency, community health, in addition to functional (features) and non functional (security, best practices, etc) maturity of the project with respect to its stated goals and roadmap. 

> **NOTE:** The FINOS Lifecycle was updated in 2026 to reflect evolution of the foundation and now aligns closely with the [CNCF maturity model](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/README.md). 

# Why is the Project Lifecycle needed?

  * **For Consumers:** The lifecycle is designed to help users easily determine which projects are appropriate for their use, whether it be experimentation or production use. 
 * **For Maintainers:** The lifecycle gives FINOS maintainers a roadmap for progressing their projects towards increasing levels of maturity. 
 * **For FINOS Staff:** The lifecycle gives FINOS staff a way to offer access to different benefits (and therefore incentives) to projects which are more appropriate for their lifecycle stage.

# FINOS Lifecycle Stages

Projects in FINOS can be in one of the following lifecycle stages: 

| Badge | Lifecycle Stage Details                                              | What does it signal to consumers?                                                                                                                                                              |

|   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finos/contrib-toolbox/master/images/badge-labs.png" width="150" />    | [Labs](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/labs)             | This stage is the default entry point for all FINOS projects which **are in an initial exploratory or experimental phase** while still hosted in a neutrally governed space overseen by FINOS. |
|   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finos/contrib-toolbox/master/images/badge-incubating.png" width="150" />    | [Incubating](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/incubating) | This stage is for projects with high potential in early growth phase in terms of their functionality, maturity, and community sustainability.                                                  |
|   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finos/contrib-toolbox/master/images/badge-graduated.png" width="150"/>    | [Graduated](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/graduated)   | This stage is the highest maturity stage, for active projects with healthy and diverse contributor and adopter communities                                                                     |
|   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finos/contrib-toolbox/master/images/badge-archived.png" width="150"/>    | [Archived](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/archived)     | This stage is for projects that, while potentially still highly valuable, are no longer actively maintained.                                                                                   |

Please review individual lifecycle stage pages for detailed information about what each stage represents for consumers, what are the criteria and ongoing requirements for projects to be in a lifecycle stage and instructions for maintainers how to apply for each stage.

# FINOS Lifecycle Governance

Per [TOC responsiblities](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee/blob/main/operations/governance.md#responsibilities), the [TOC](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee/) is responsible for:

- Maintaining and evolving all lifecycle stages definitions
- Approve lifecycle transitions (or new contributions) to the Incubating, Graduated and Archived stages
- resolve any potential dispute that may occur between project maintainers and who is proposing an archival transition

The FINOS Staff is responsible for:

- Accepting new projects into Labs stage according to the [FINOS Labs](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/labs) requirements
