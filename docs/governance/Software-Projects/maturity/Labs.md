title: FINOS Labs Projects
---

## Definitions
Projects in the FINOS Labs stage are in an experimental and exploratory phase. 

Labs projects must comply with a formal checklist defined by the [Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee) and enforced by the FINOS staff. After acceptance, they must also adhere to a short list of ongoing maintenance requirements.

To clearly differentiate their early stage maturity, projects in this stage are hosted in the dedicated [FINOS Labs](https://github.com/finos-labs/) Github org, separate from the main [FINOS org](https://github.com/finos).

## Objectives
The objective of the Labs labs stage is to provide a low-friction environment to allow the project team to experiment under a neutral governance in the open, and work through their concepts collaboratively within the FINOS umbrella.   

This stage serves the default entry stage for all new projects contributed to FINOS, allowing for quickly contributing / starting a collaborative project under neutral governance. 

This stage is also used to support FINOS hackathon providing an immediately open source outlet for projects built during these events. 

## How to apply for FINOS Labs

If you are a FINOS Member and would like to contribute a new opens source or open standard project into Labs, please follow the [new Project contribution process](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution#contribution-of-a-new-FINOS-project-or-SIG) to:

1. detail the proposal
2. evidence your compliance the [FINOS Labs Acceptance Requirements](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/labs#labs-acceptance-requirements)
3. commit to fulfill the [FINOS Labs ongoing maintainance requirements](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/labs#labs-ongoing-maintenance-requirements).

If you believe your project is more mature than a Labs project, at the time of contribution you will have an option to evidence compliance with later stages and contextually request the [Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee) to award [Incubating](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/incubating) or [Graduated](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/graduated) stage.

## Requirements

### Labs Acceptance Requirements

The following factors must be confirmed before the project can be accepted and onboarded as a FINOS Labs Project.

- Project has a clear use case for the financial services industry
- Next steps for development are documented in the README or a linked document
- Project name and logo, if extant, comply with the [FINOS trademark requirements](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution#trademark); Otherwise a new name / logo is agreed during contribution
- Project's license must comply with the [FINOS IP Policy](https://community.finos.org/governance-docs/IP-policy.pdf)
- The above may be brought into compliance during the contribution process before final onboarding

### Labs Ongoing Maintenance Requirements

The following must remain true for projects at all times. A Health Review may be done by the FINOS TOC or Staff as often as once every six months. Project support will be offered in the event that a project is found to be out of compliance. If a project remains out of compliance for two consecutive Health Reviews, it will qualify for archival.

- All _Labs_ acceptance requirements
- Public FINOS GitHub repository must have development activity since the last Health Review
- Completion of any action items issued to the project following a vote of the TOC
- LICENSE, NOTICE and CONTRIBUTING files conform to [FINOS compliance requirements](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution-compliance-requirements#license-information)
- All community meetings are run according to [FINOS meeting procedures](/docs/governance/meeting-procedures)
- The appropriate FINOS Labs Project Status Badge is displayed at the top of the project README
- All official project websites or related assets are owned and hosted by FINOS
- Use of an automated build and release pipeline when releases are made
- Released artifacts must be distributed under a FINOS namespace following language-specific best practices
- Demonstrated adherence to Maturity Level 1 of the [Open Source Project Security Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org/)

### Transition out of Labs
As projects become more mature they have several options to progress:

1. Transition into FINOS Incubating stage by [requesting incubation](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/new?assignees=maoo%2C+TheJuanAndOnly99&labels=&template=Project-Incubation.md&title=projectName+Incubation+Request).
2. Transition into FINOS Graduated stage by [requesting graduation](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/new?assignees=maoo%2C+TheJuanAndOnly99&labels=&template=Project-Graduation.md&title=projectName+Graduation+Request).
3. Graduate to another LF foundation (if scope / audience has grown beyond finance)
5. Archive
