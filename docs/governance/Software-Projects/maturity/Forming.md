# Badge

Foundation-hosted projects are expected to provide a clear indication to visitors that they are in an incubating stage.  To this end, the Foundation provides a badge that should be displayed at the top of the project's root-level `README.md` file, using the following Markdown:

```
[![FINOS - Forming](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/finos/contrib-toolbox@master/images/badge-forming.svg)](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/forming)
```

Forming projects are not publicly visible (yet) but if you are a [FINOS Member](https://finos.org/members) you can request to added to a specific forming project by emailing help@finos.org

# Definition

Optionally, before a project is formally contributed (in either [Labs](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/labs) or Incubating stage), a FINOS Platinum Member might request to work privately with other prospective contributor FINOS Members to gauge viability and evaluate interest ahead of formal contribution during what's referred as "formation". 

Projects which successfully complete the Formation stage are expected to become fully open source within one year.

## Objectives

The objectives of the Forming stage are to gauge viability and interest for a project that is not ready for full open source availability, because of effort, quality or confidentiality reasons. 

The ultimate goal is to build an initial community that can ensure the project is sustainable once open sourced.

## Requirements

The only requirement for a project to be accepted into Forming stage is for a FINOS Platinum Member to request it. As the project undergoes formation it will be striving to achieve the Labs or Incubating requirements ahead of contribution.

### Migration out of Forming

1. [New Project contribution](/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution#contribution-of-a-new-FINOS-project-or-SIG) into FINOS (as Labs or Incubating)
2. Formation effort is abandoned
