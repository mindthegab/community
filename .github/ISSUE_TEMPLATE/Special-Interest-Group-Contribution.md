# Prerequisites

## Membership requirement to contribute new projects
Please note that only FINOS members can propose new Special Interest Groups. If you're interested in membership, see [here](https://www.finos.org/membership-benefits#become-a-member). You can still submit this contribution if your organization is not a [FINOS member](https://finos.org/members), but you will be required to have a maintainer from a FINOS member.

- [ ] I confirm I am contributing on behalf of a FINOS member (`add FINOS member organization name`) or I will seek a maintainer from a FINOS member during socialization 

## Understading the contribution Process
Completing an onboarding of a special interest group into FINOS comprises following 5 main steps described in details in our [Community Repository](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution#contribution-of-an-existing-code-base-into-finos-as-a-new-project). 

 - [ ] I confirm I have reviewed the contribution process.

## Understanding FINOS

As a SIG onboarding into FINOS, you should familiarize yourself and your contributor team with the following FINOS information: [FINOS overview](https://www.finos.org/hubfs/An%20Introduction%20to%20FINOS.pdf), [FINOS SIG Governance](/docs/governance/#special-interest-groups)), [FINOS Maintainers cheatsheet](https://community.finos.org/docs/finos-maintainers-cheatsheet/).

- [ ] I confirm I am familiar with the FINOS governance and maintainers (Chair) responsibilities

# Next steps and what to expect 

## 1. Socialisation 
It's highly recommended that once you submit this issue, you or anyone in the maintainer team proceed with socializing directly to the [FINOS community](mailto:community@finos.org) and through your personal network. The goal is to generate interest, support and ideally additional committed participant expressing the interest on the issue before it's sent to the Governing Board for approval. 

Instructions and a template for you to adjust are avaialble in the [Contribution Process Socialization](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/contribution/#step-2-socialization) documentation.

- [ ] I confirm I have socialized this contribution to `community@finos.org` (to be checked after the issue is raised)

# 2. Approval
The [FINOS Governing Board]([https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee](https://www.finos.org/governing-board)) is responsible for approving new FINOS standards.

Once you are happy with the socialization phase (garnered enough support / interest, addressed open questions, etc), please prepare a short slide deck (10m), check the box below, and put a comment on this issue so the proposal can be sent to the Governing Board for approval via email or at the next Governing Board meeting 

- [ ] I am happy for this issue to be sent to the Governing Board for formal review and approval and I prepared a short SIG proposal deck for the FINOS Governing Board `replace [this template](/governance-docs/202103-New-Project-or-SIG-proposal-(template)-PUBLIC.pptx) with link or attach to the issue` 
- [ ] FINOS team notified leadership@finos.org to trigger Governing Board approval and assigned this issue to COO
- [ ] FINOS Leadership confirmed timing and procedure of Governing Board vote with contributors

### Governing Board Approval findings 
- [ ] FINOS Governing Board reviewed the contribution and the contribution was: `accepted|rejected`

> FINOS team to enter high level findings summary here supporting the decision

## 3. Preparing For Onboarding
Before the FINOS team can onboard your project, there are a few housekeeping items that need to be taken care of from an IP and infastructure standpoint. These must be completed by the contributor, with help if required from the FINOS Infrastructure team, so please familiarize yourself with the [requirements](/docs/governance/software-projects/contribution/#step-4-ip-review--transfer-of-contributions).

### Steps
- [ ] Usable name and logo identified (either existing or new)
  - [ ] FINOS team confirmed project brand and logo are usable in the public domain. This might require completion of [project contribution agreement](https://community.finos.org/governance-docs/The.Linux.Foundation.--.Form.of.Trademark.Assignment.20221202.pdf) to properly assign trademarks.
  - [ ] Failed the above, new project name and logo is identified
- [ ] FINOS team enabled documentation DCO (developer certificate of origin) to enforce CC-by-40 license, [default for SIGs](/docs/governance#special-interest-groups)
- [ ] FINOS team was given admin access to any existing project account (e.g. GitHub, domain names, social media) to be able to act on behalf of the contributor for accounts related to the project 
- [ ] Kick-off meeting organized by FINOS team, including:
   - [ ] Review contribution checklist with FINOS staff
   - [ ] Contributor confirms having reviewed and agreed to [FINOS SIG governance](/docs/governance#special-interest-groups) and [FINOS meeting procedures](/docs/governance/meeting-procedures)
   - [ ] FINOS agrees with Chairs on category and sub-category (for [FINOS Landscape](https://landscape.finos.org/) placement
   groups)

## 4.  Transfer and onboarding in FINOS
This is performed by FINOS Infra once the three previous stages are complete, with support from the contributor and the FINOS Infra team.

## Code transfer preparation
- [ ] Maintainer has made [finos-admin](http://github.com/finos-admin) Admin of the GitHub repository to transfer

## Existing assets transfer Meeting
- [ ] Transfer all assets as GitHub repositories under github.com/finos
- [ ] Rename main branch to `main` (instead of `master`)
- [ ] Check that CVE (and preferably static code analysis, if applicable) scanning is in place
- [ ] Enable [branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) (`Require a pull request before merging`)
- [ ] Enable automated dependency update, using [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/)
- [ ] (best effort or to be completed right after onboarding) Update release coordinates and code namespace to include `finos`
- [ ] Communication channels are linked front and center in the project README.md
- [ ] Communication channels are linked front and center in the project README.md
- [ ] SIG badge is updated
- [ ] SIG is listed in [FINOS SIGs listing page](/docs/governance/special-interest-
